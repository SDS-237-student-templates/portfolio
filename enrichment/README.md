## Instructions

To earn enrichment credit, you should complete three of the following by the end of the semester:

### Option 1: Lead a class reading dicussion

> Lead a 20-minute class reading discussion. In this role, you will prepare a written discussion plan in `discussion-plan.Rmd` that summarizes the main arguments/key points of the assigned reading (in at least 250 words, lists 5 memorable quotes from the reading with page numbers, synthesizes 2-3 key issues that came up in the Perusall threads, lists out 3 discussion questions, and includes 5 links to relevant articles, videos, stories, images, etc, that you may reference during discussion. During class, you will summarize the weekâ€™s reading and Perusall discussions in the first 5 minutes, and then lead the class discussion, drawing from your questions and materials.  Please note that you **will not** have time to cover all of the material in your discussion plan in a 20-minute discussion. I'm asking you to develop this material so that you are better prepared to frame the discussion and respond to student questions. Most likely, there will be time to discuss, at most, two rich discussion questions. 

### Option 2: Ethnographic Reflexivity Memo

> Write a 500-600-word memo in `reflexive-memo.Rmd` reflecting on your role as the researcher in one of your ethnographic mini-projects. Think of this like a meta-analysis of the research encounter. You might address questions like: How would you characterize your standpoint in relation to the research? In what ways did your background and situated knowledge inflect how you approached your research and what you took away from it? In what moments were there communication break-downs with your informants and why? What feelings came up for you during research? What ethical considerations were you grappling with as you engaged the research?

### Option 3: Fieldnote Synthesis Memo

> Write a 500-600-word memo in `fieldnote-synthesis.Rmd` synthesizing and making broader connections across at least 3 of your journal entries. What have you learned about how data and culture co-constitute each other via your fieldnotes? You might think about how data discourse, education, expertise, or infrastructures materialize, operate, transform, or get contested. Be sure to cite specific examples from each of the entries in your response.

### Option 4: Double Community Labor

> Earn 16 community labor points by the end of the semester.
