# Interview a data professional

For this assignment you will conduct a 30-minute Zoom interview with an individual for whom data figures centrally in their work. The goal of your interview will be to deepen understanding of the cultures of data work. 

## Identifying a data professional, scheduling an interview, and obtaining consent

If you choose this assignment, it will be your responsibility to identify a data professional, reach out to them (cc'ing me), and coordinate an interview time well in advance of the project due date. There is a template for emailing an individual provided in this repo, along with a consent form the person you interview should sign. Keep in mind that, while your SDS professors may be an obvious first choice, they cannot support interviews with all of the students in our course. I encourage you to think expansively about who you might interview. I'm happy to offer suggestions on identifying an appropriate person in student consultation hours. 

## Preparing for the interview

You should write up 10 open-ended questions in `interview-questions.Rmd` in preparation for the interview. While you won't be able to cover everything in 30 minutes, you may decide to focus on asking questions that get at one of the following issues: 

* pathways into data work and how data expertise develops, 
* how ideas about the role, significance, and representativeness of data form,
* what day-to-day interactions with data are like,
* how data work is valued and rewarded,
* how individuals perceive their sense of belonging in data communities, along with social factors that lead to feelings of exclusion,
* norms of behavior in data communities and how/when they are contested

## During the interview

Ask the interviewee if they are comfortable with you recording the conversation. You may record with their express permission.

## Write-up

Following your interview, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo in `interview-writeup.Rmd` describing and interpreting what was discussed throughout the conversation. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.

## Criteria for completion

* Student fills out `interview-questions.Rmd` with 10 relevant interview questions developed in preparation for the interview.
* Student writes a 750-1000 word memo in `interview-writeup.Rmd` describing and interpreting what was discussed in the interview.
