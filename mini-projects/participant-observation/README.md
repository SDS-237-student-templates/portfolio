# Participant observation of a data setting

For this assignment, you will observe a setting in which data figures centrally. You may choose to observe a class engaging in some form of data collection, a hack-a-thon, or even a friend working on a coding assignment for a data science course. The only data setting that I discourage for this assignment is talks that are being presented on-line. These are better suited for the discourse analysis mini-project. 

You may attend the event either in-person of virtually. Throughout the event you should take extensive field notes (at least 6 double-spaced, typed pages) about the physical environment of the event, how people behave and interact, how people talk about and data, the rituals they perform, the infrastructures they engage, and more generally how data figures into the social setting. You will record these fieldnotes in `participant-observation-fieldnotes.Rmd`.

## Write-up

Following your observation, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo in `participant-observation-writeup.Rmd` describing the event and offering a qualitative interpretive analysis of how the event illustrates something about the culture of data advocacy, discourse, creation, or use.  Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.

## Criteria for completion

* Student submits the equivalent of about 6 double-spaced typed pages of field notes taken during the event in `participant-observation-fieldnotes.Rmd`.
* Student writes a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the event in `participant-observation-writeup.Rmd`.
