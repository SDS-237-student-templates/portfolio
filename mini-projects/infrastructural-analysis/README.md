# Cultural analysis of a data infrastructure

For this assignment, you will identify a dataset that includes *either* 1) select a standard classification system into which values get organized, or 2) select a standard index/formula used to calculate certain types of values. You will then investigate that information infrastructure through a socio-cultural lens, aiming to respond to the question: What is the master narrative that is conveyed through this information infrastructure? You may briefly research the history of changes to the infrastructure; however, this assignment is *not a literature review*, and you should limit your use of secondary sources to support your arguments. This paper should represent **your** cultural analysis of this dataset, not that of others. To do so, you should closely examine the structure of the classification or index/formula, considering what forms of representation it affords and what it eclipses. In your research, you may also wish to identify different forms of social advocacy involved in shaping the infrastructure's master narrative. If you can find public commentary, legislative sessions, government hearings, op-eds, etc where individuals had advocated for certain changes to the dataset, I would consider these primary sources and would be thrilled to see them cited in your work. 

## Selecting a data infrastructure

Before you select an infrastructure, you should identify a public dataset that organizes information into a series categories or calculates values according to a particular index or formula. 

Examples of classification systems that I've seen referenced in public datasets include:

* Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) or the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)
* Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education
* BISAC Subject Headings List
* Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)

Examples of standard indices/formulas you may select include:

* Official Poverty Measure (OPM)
* Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

## Analyzing the data infrastructure

First, you should navigate through the documentation for the infrastructure, reflecting on how concepts are organized and sub-organized, along with notable absences. What cultural stories does this infrastructure convey? How does the infrastructure reflect the socio-cultural conditions that when into its creation?

Second, you should develop a timeline of changes to the data infrastructure in `infrastructural-analysis-timeline.Rmd`. You should research the stakeholder groups that had been at the table for each change, and consider how each event impacted the infrastructure's master narrative. 

Third, you may look for *primary sources* where different stakeholders advocated for particular configurations of or changes to the infrastructure. By primary sources, I mean that you should find sources created by the stakeholder groups whose claims you are examining, not summaries of what had been happening at the time. You might consider looking for op-eds, public hearings, blog posts, public comments on websites like Regulations.gov, etc.

Finally, you should consider how everything you learned shaped the way values are presented in the dataset where you originally identified this infrastructure. 


## Write-up

Following your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo in `infrastructural-analysis-writeup.Rmd` presenting an an answer to the question: What is the master narrative that is conveyed through this information infrastructure? You should engage thick description as you detail the structure and organization of the infrastructure and interpret its symbolic meaning. 

I want to emphasize that this is not a literature review, and you should not approach this assignment simply by regurgitating what you learn in sources you find. Instead, you should focus on analyzing the ways in which the infrastructure both enables and delimits knowledge production by closely studying how its component parts are organized and how they impact your dataset, along with which stakeholder groups advocated for certain changes. The sources you find should serve to provide context for the points that you make. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.

## Criteria for completion

* Student presents a timeline for the information infrastructure in `infrastructural-analysis-timeline.Rmd` with at least five key dates. All columns in the table are filled in with relevant information.  
* Student writes a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the data infrastructure in `infrastructural-analysis-writeup.Rmd`. All sources are properly cited in the write-up.
