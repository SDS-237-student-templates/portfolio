# Discourse Analysis

For this assignment, you have two options: you can 1) watch 1 video (at least 45 minutes long) of a talk about data delivered by a data scientist, or 2) three TED talks (at least 15 minutes each) about data. Please confirm your selection with me ahead of time by DM'ing me on Slack.

## Analyzing the talks

Following the framework in `discourse-analysis-worksheet.Rmd`, you should examine how data is talked about in the video(s). Consider the epistemologies vocalized, the binary oppositions that structure the language, the rhetorical strategies used, and what this tells us about data culture. You should take detailed notes by responding to at least one question in each of the nine sections of `discourse-analysis-worksheet.Rmd`. As "data" to back up claims regarding what you notice about the discourse, you should transcribe a series of quotes from the talks. You can add these quotes directly to the worksheet.  

## Write-up

Following your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo in `discourse-analysis-writeup.Rmd` detailing the discourse conveyed in the talk(s). Direct quotations should be referenced throughout (and cited) to back up your claims, but do not count towards the overall word count. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up. If you choose option 2, you should offer some comparison and/or synthesis of the discourse across the talks.

## Criteria for completion

* Student fills out `discourse-analysis-worksheet.Rmd` by responding to at least one of the questions in each of the nine sections of the worksheet. 
* Student writes a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse of the talk in `discourse-analysis-writeup.Rmd`. Direct quotations are included as evidence, and not included in the overall word count.
